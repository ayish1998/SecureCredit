## Inspiration üí°
Growing up witnessing the financial exclusion of millions across Africa, I saw how traditional banking systems failed to serve the continent's most vulnerable populations. When 66% of Africa's population remains unbanked, yet mobile money adoption soars past 50% in countries like Kenya and Ghana, I realized we needed intelligent security solutions designed specifically for Africa's unique financial landscape.

The intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and mobile financial services presents an unprecedented opportunity to protect and empower Africa's digital financial revolution while building credit histories for the previously invisible.
