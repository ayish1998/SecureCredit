# Credit Scoring System Requirements

## Introduction

The credit scoring system provides intelligent credit assessment for unbanked populations across Africa using alternative data sources, primarily mobile money transaction history. The system must generate accurate credit scores in real-time while ensuring fairness and regulatory compliance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Alternative Credit Assessment

**User Story:** As a financial inclusion officer, I want to assess creditworthiness using mobile money data, so that unbanked users can access credit services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests credit assessment THEN the system SHALL analyze mobile money transaction history
2. WHEN traditional credit data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use alternative data sources
3. WHEN sufficient transaction history exists THEN the system SHALL generate a credit score within 5 seconds
4. IF insufficient data is available THEN the system SHALL provide a preliminary assessment with confidence intervals

### Requirement 2: Real-time Credit Score Updates

**User Story:** As a lending officer, I want credit scores to update automatically with new transaction data, so that lending decisions reflect current financial behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new transactions are processed THEN the system SHALL update credit scores within 1 hour
2. WHEN significant behavioral changes occur THEN the system SHALL trigger immediate score recalculation
3. WHEN score changes exceed 50 points THEN the system SHALL notify relevant stakeholders
4. IF score calculation fails THEN the system SHALL maintain previous score and log errors

### Requirement 3: Risk Level Categorization

**User Story:** As a risk manager, I want users categorized by risk levels, so that appropriate lending terms can be applied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credit scores are calculated THEN the system SHALL assign risk categories (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, No Score)
2. WHEN risk levels change THEN the system SHALL update user classifications automatically
3. WHEN borderline scores occur THEN the system SHALL provide additional risk indicators
4. IF categorization is uncertain THEN the system SHALL flag for manual review
