# Fraud Detection System Requirements

## Introduction

The fraud detection system is a core component of SecureCredit that provides real-time analysis of financial transactions to identify and prevent fraudulent activities across Africa's mobile money ecosystem. The system must process millions of transactions daily while maintaining high accuracy and low latency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-time Transaction Analysis

**User Story:** As a financial security analyst, I want the system to analyze transactions in real-time, so that fraudulent activities can be detected and prevented immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction is initiated THEN the system SHALL analyze it within 100ms
2. WHEN suspicious patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL flag the transaction for review
3. WHEN a transaction exceeds risk thresholds THEN the system SHALL block it automatically
4. IF the analysis cannot be completed within 200ms THEN the system SHALL allow the transaction and log for post-processing

### Requirement 2: Behavioral Pattern Recognition

**User Story:** As a fraud prevention specialist, I want the system to learn user behavior patterns, so that deviations indicating fraud can be identified accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs transactions THEN the system SHALL build a behavioral profile
2. WHEN transaction patterns deviate significantly from user history THEN the system SHALL increase risk score
3. WHEN location patterns are inconsistent THEN the system SHALL flag for geographic risk analysis
4. IF behavioral data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL use alternative risk indicators

### Requirement 3: Device Fingerprinting

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to track device characteristics, so that unauthorized device usage can be detected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction occurs THEN the system SHALL capture device fingerprint data
2. WHEN a new device is used THEN the system SHALL require additional verification
3. WHEN device characteristics change suspiciously THEN the system SHALL increase risk assessment
4. IF device fingerprinting fails THEN the system SHALL use alternative authentication methods

### Requirement 4: Machine Learning Model Integration

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to integrate ML models for fraud detection, so that accuracy improves over time through learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new transaction data is available THEN the system SHALL update ML models
2. WHEN model accuracy drops below 95% THEN the system SHALL retrain automatically
3. WHEN predictions are made THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores
4. IF model inference fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to rule-based detection

### Requirement 5: Alert and Notification System

**User Story:** As a fraud analyst, I want to receive immediate alerts for high-risk transactions, so that manual review can be conducted promptly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fraud probability exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts
2. WHEN multiple suspicious transactions occur THEN the system SHALL escalate notifications
3. WHEN alerts are generated THEN the system SHALL include transaction details and risk factors
4. IF notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry and log failures
