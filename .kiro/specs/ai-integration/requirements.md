# AI Integration Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate Google's Gemini AI API to provide intelligent fraud detection, credit scoring analysis, and security recommendations within the SecureCredit platform. The AI will enhance the existing mock data with real-time intelligent analysis and predictions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AI-Powered Fraud Detection

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want AI to analyze transaction patterns and provide intelligent fraud detection insights, so that I can make more accurate fraud prevention decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction is analyzed THEN the system SHALL use Gemini AI to evaluate fraud risk patterns
2. WHEN suspicious patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL generate detailed AI-powered risk assessments
3. WHEN fraud analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores and reasoning
4. IF the AI confidence score is above 80% THEN the system SHALL automatically flag high-risk transactions

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Credit Scoring

**User Story:** As a loan officer, I want AI to enhance credit scoring with intelligent analysis of financial behavior patterns, so that I can make more informed lending decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credit scoring is performed THEN the system SHALL use AI to analyze financial behavior patterns
2. WHEN AI analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide enhanced credit recommendations
3. WHEN credit factors are evaluated THEN the system SHALL explain AI reasoning behind scores
4. IF credit data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL suggest additional data points for better analysis

### Requirement 3: Security Intelligence

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want AI to analyze device fingerprints and security patterns, so that I can proactively identify security threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN device fingerprinting occurs THEN the system SHALL use AI to analyze security patterns
2. WHEN security threats are detected THEN the system SHALL provide AI-powered threat assessments
3. WHEN security analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL recommend specific security actions
4. IF anomalous behavior is detected THEN the system SHALL generate intelligent security alerts

### Requirement 4: Secure API Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the AI integration to be secure and properly configured, so that sensitive data and API keys are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API keys are configured THEN the system SHALL store them securely using environment variables
2. WHEN AI requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and rate limiting
3. WHEN sensitive data is processed THEN the system SHALL ensure data privacy and compliance
4. IF API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to existing functionality
